---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Built with **Vue 3** and **Composition API**
- 🎨 Styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- 🧩 Fully **modular and reusable** components
- ⚙️ Highly **configurable** via props and scoped controllers
- 📁 Organized into clear categories: Forms, Navigation, Display, Layout, etc.

## 🧩 Usage

Import any component into your Vue app:

```js
import TopBarUI from "@ui/Navigation/TopBar/top_bar_ui.vue";

<TopBarUI :config="topBarConfig" />
```

Example config object:

```js
const topBarConfig = {
  background_color: '#f9f9f9',
  height: 92,
  has_shadow: true,
  section_1_component: ImageTextUI,
  section_1_props: {
    text: "My App",
    text_class: "text-lg font-bold",
    image_src: "/logo.png",
  }
};
```

## 🧠 Customization

Each component:

* Comes with a dedicated **controller class** to handle logic, configuration defaults, and Vue lifecycle hooks.
* Can be dynamically rendered using `<component :is="...">` patterns.
* Can be extended or overridden for specific use cases.

---

## 💡 Development Tips

* Use `markRaw()` from Vue to pass components via props without reactivity overhead.
* Extend and wrap base components in your apps to preserve core logic and style consistency.
* Use Tailwind utility classes via `class_style` props for custom appearance.
